      <description>&amp;lsquo;A Time of Changes&amp;rsquo; by Robert Silverberg puts us in the mind of Kinnal Darival, a middle-aged exiled Prince as he&amp;rsquo;s pursued across a punishing desert for his counter-cultural transformation. In Borthan, no greater a verbal crime exists than that of &amp;lsquo;self-baring&amp;rsquo;. Like a high-school history essay, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;me&amp;rsquo; are illegal according to the Covenant of the world&amp;rsquo;s colonisation, and citizens must speak in verbose roundabouts to avoid too great a focus on their own existence or feelings.</description>

      <description>In 1972 Nebula Award nominee &amp;lsquo;The Iron Dream&amp;rsquo;, Norman Spinrad asks the question: What if Hitler had written a science fiction novel? The Iron Dream thus forms a novel within a novel, as beside an introduction and afterword, the reader is thrust into &amp;lsquo;The Lord of the Swastika&amp;rsquo;, Hitler&amp;rsquo;s most famous science fiction work. The Lord of the Swastika presents a homoerotic tale of world domination where the true human genotype is restored to primacy in a post-apocalyptic Europe.</description>
