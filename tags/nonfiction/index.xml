      <description>‘L’Âge des Low-Tech’ or ‘The Age of Low Tech’ by Philippe Bihouix asks the question: Can we out-think our consumption of resources? According to Bihouix, the answer is a resounding no. No amount of technological innovation will be able to support the technologically complex lifestyles we now prefer. In the face of anthropogenic environmental impacts, Bihouix posits that our prime solution lies not in technological innovations which shift to alternate environmental impacts, but in the technical simplifcation of our societies.</description>

      <description>‘The Harlem Renaissance’ provides a keen look into the interwar African-American literary movement after which it is titled. Wintz provides both a history and anthology of key pieces from the movement in his efforts to provide a comprehensive overview of the historical key authors and themes. I will attempt in this review to address primarily the efforts of Wintz and not the writers which he included in the anthology that made up the bulk of the book.</description>

      <description>A part of the Oxford ‘A Very Short Introduction’ series, ‘Judaism’ by Norman Solomon aims to introduce key concepts of Judaism and Jewish history to the gentile reader. The book covers various aspects of Judaism and Jewish history in a fairly informal ‘question and answer’ style. The sections of the book include key faith concepts, the split between Christianity and Judaism, history of sacred texts, celebrations, spiritual practice, Zionism, persecution and more.</description>

      <description>This month I&amp;rsquo;ll be travelling to Israel, Egypt and Greece before jetting off to Thailand at the end of the month. This means that I may not have a ton of time for reading depending on how long I&amp;rsquo;ll be out each day and able to stand the sweltering heat. However, I am currently in the middle of a few books. My general goals with reading this year centred around language learning - namely Spanish and French.</description>

      <title>Are simplified language texts worth reading in language learning? - Western Philsophy in Simple Spanish by Olly Richards</title>

      <description>In my quest to learn Spanish, and my continued attempts to maintain my French, have led me to the &amp;lsquo;input method&amp;rsquo; of language learning. According to this, the primary thing which determines a language learners command of the language is the amount of comprehensible, high-quality input which they get. Naturally, it can be very difficult when first starting a language to understand anything, let alone native-level media on subjects that you&amp;rsquo;d be interested in.</description>

      <description>The Grand Chessboard by Zbigniew Brzeziński explores the world according to America (at least, in 1997.) Brzeziński was a Polish-born political analyst with no shortage of high-profile roles on his resume, serving as a counsellor to Johnson from &amp;lsquo;66-68 and National Security Advisor from &amp;lsquo;77-81 under Carter. The Grand Chessboard presents Brzeziński&amp;rsquo;s own geopolitical analysis of the world and its various key &amp;lsquo;pieces&amp;rsquo; to the American Imperial puzzle. Thus, it particularly focuses on Europe (particularly France and Germany), Russia, the Caucasus, and China in their geopolitical contexts.</description>
