      <description>At just 21 years old I have accomplished an overwhelming amount of nothing, so if this blog brightens even one persons day I&amp;rsquo;d be stoked. In my normal, not-on-the-internet life I frequent my university where I&amp;rsquo;m studying a double degree in Arts and IT. I spend way too little time doing coursework, so writing random blog posts provides an entertaining way to procrastinate, and given the Coronapocalypse that&amp;rsquo;s going on as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this it&amp;rsquo;s also providing a useful distraction from the world.</description>

      <description>A part of the Oxford ‘A Very Short Introduction’ series, ‘Judaism’ by Norman Solomon aims to introduce key concepts of Judaism and Jewish history to the gentile reader. The book covers various aspects of Judaism and Jewish history in a fairly informal ‘question and answer’ style. The sections of the book include key faith concepts, the split between Christianity and Judaism, history of sacred texts, celebrations, spiritual practice, Zionism, persecution and more.</description>

      <description>If at any time you find yourself enamoured by the thrum of a metropolis, by Melbourne, Rome, Manchester or any other suitably sized place, ‘Berlin Stories’ will put words to the possibility you feel pulsing there. Robert Walser, in his signature ‘prose pieces’ – a combination of poetic prose and essay – perfectly encapsulates what is so invigorating about a city. Masterfully selected, the ‘Berlin Stories’ collection edited by Susan Bernovsky traverses Walser’s time in Berlin: from joyful youth to the still joyful but matured man who eventually returned to his Swiss origin.</description>

      <description>This month I&amp;rsquo;ll be travelling to Israel, Egypt and Greece before jetting off to Thailand at the end of the month. This means that I may not have a ton of time for reading depending on how long I&amp;rsquo;ll be out each day and able to stand the sweltering heat. However, I am currently in the middle of a few books. My general goals with reading this year centred around language learning - namely Spanish and French.</description>

      <title>A Time of Changes by Robert Silverberg</title>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;A Time of Changes&amp;rsquo; by Robert Silverberg puts us in the mind of Kinnal Darival, a middle-aged exiled Prince as he&amp;rsquo;s pursued across a punishing desert for his counter-cultural transformation. In Borthan, no greater a verbal crime exists than that of &amp;lsquo;self-baring&amp;rsquo;. Like a high-school history essay, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;me&amp;rsquo; are illegal according to the Covenant of the world&amp;rsquo;s colonisation, and citizens must speak in verbose roundabouts to avoid too great a focus on their own existence or feelings.</description>

      <title>Are simplified language texts worth reading in language learning? - Western Philsophy in Simple Spanish by Olly Richards</title>
      <link>https://specual.me/posts/westernphilosophyinspanish/</link>

      <description>In my quest to learn Spanish, and my continued attempts to maintain my French, have led me to the &amp;lsquo;input method&amp;rsquo; of language learning. According to this, the primary thing which determines a language learners command of the language is the amount of comprehensible, high-quality input which they get. Naturally, it can be very difficult when first starting a language to understand anything, let alone native-level media on subjects that you&amp;rsquo;d be interested in.</description>

      <title>The Grand Chessboard of 1997; Or, The World According to America</title>

      <description>The Grand Chessboard by Zbigniew Brzeziński explores the world according to America (at least, in 1997.) Brzeziński was a Polish-born political analyst with no shortage of high-profile roles on his resume, serving as a counsellor to Johnson from &amp;lsquo;66-68 and National Security Advisor from &amp;lsquo;77-81 under Carter. The Grand Chessboard presents Brzeziński&amp;rsquo;s own geopolitical analysis of the world and its various key &amp;lsquo;pieces&amp;rsquo; to the American Imperial puzzle. Thus, it particularly focuses on Europe (particularly France and Germany), Russia, the Caucasus, and China in their geopolitical contexts.</description>

      <title>What if Hitler had written sci-fi? - The Iron Dream by Norman Spinrad</title>

      <description>In 1972 Nebula Award nominee &amp;lsquo;The Iron Dream&amp;rsquo;, Norman Spinrad asks the question: What if Hitler had written a science fiction novel? The Iron Dream thus forms a novel within a novel, as beside an introduction and afterword, the reader is thrust into &amp;lsquo;The Lord of the Swastika&amp;rsquo;, Hitler&amp;rsquo;s most famous science fiction work. The Lord of the Swastika presents a homoerotic tale of world domination where the true human genotype is restored to primacy in a post-apocalyptic Europe.</description>

      <title>What happens when you stop loving YA?</title>

      <description>For many of us who have grown up to be voracious readers, the Young Adult literary space is a reliable and familiar home. On choosing a YA book, you are somewhat guaranteed to encounter simple prose and young, often female main characters in ‘coming-of-age’ stories. Young Adult is not restricted by genres like science fiction or romance, and it is a perfectly valid place to stay if you’re happy there. But what do you do, if like me, young adult starts to wear thin.</description>
