			<p>At just 20 years old I have accomplished an overwhelming amount of nothing, so if this blog brightens even one persons day I&rsquo;d be stoked. In my normal, not-on-the-internet life I frequent my university where I&rsquo;m studying a double degree in Arts and IT. I spend way too little time doing coursework, so writing random blog posts provides an entertaining way to procrastinate, and given the Coronapocalypse that&rsquo;s going on as I&rsquo;m writing this it&rsquo;s also providing a useful distraction from the world.</p>
<p>On this blog you&rsquo;ll find reviews of every kind as well as occasional nonsense. I love reading and sharing reviews of perhaps lesser known books and authors, so if you&rsquo;re looking to get acquainted with something new I hope you&rsquo;ll find it here. If you enjoy a post please drop a comment so that I know you exist (it would be a great comfort to know the zombie apocalypse hasn&rsquo;t started without me noticing.)</p>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<p>I currently have some level of reading proficiency in four languages, with my native English being the best. However, I do also read in French, Spanish and Esperanto, and below have included some information about my proficiency in those languages to give context to any reviews I put out about books read in those languages.</p>

<h2 id="rating-system">Rating System</h2>
<p>While ratings can&rsquo;t paint the full picture on my experience of a book, they are pretty universally used across commercial book review sites and online stores. The following table shows my general rating guideline. However, in full disclosure, I do tend to rate self-pulished work a little more favourably than traditionally published work since a negative review disproportionately affects these authors. This may mean rounding up over down on a half star mind-rating, or could mean I refrain from publishing the rating on commercial sites.</p>
