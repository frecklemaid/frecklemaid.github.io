			<p>At just 21 years old I have accomplished an overwhelming amount of nothing, so if this blog brightens even one persons day I&rsquo;d be stoked. In my normal, not-on-the-internet life I frequent my university where I&rsquo;m studying a double degree in Arts and IT. I spend way too little time doing coursework, so writing random blog posts provides an entertaining way to procrastinate, and given the Coronapocalypse that&rsquo;s going on as I&rsquo;m writing this it&rsquo;s also providing a useful distraction from the world.</p>
<p>On this blog you&rsquo;ll find reviews of every kind as well as occasional nonsense. I love reading and sharing reviews of perhaps lesser known books and authors, so if you&rsquo;re looking to get acquainted with something new I hope you&rsquo;ll find it here. If you enjoy a post please drop a comment so that I know you exist (it would be a great comfort to know the zombie apocalypse hasn&rsquo;t started without me noticing.)</p>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<p>I currently have some level of reading proficiency in four languages, with my native English being the best. However, I do also read in French, Spanish and Esperanto, and below have included some information about my proficiency in those languages to give context to any reviews I put out about books read in those languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>French: Starting in High School in 2014, I&rsquo;ve since attained an upper intermediate level of French. I can hold fairly fluid conversations, listen to podcasts, watch TV and read without too much difficulty. I&rsquo;ve read at least a dozen books in French thus far, but am always looking to up that number. In 2021, I passed the DELF B2 exam. Check <a href="https://specual.me/tags/french/">here</a> for French reccommendations.</li>
<li>Spanish: Started as a 2023 New Years resolution, I have a weak lower-intermediate level of Spanish. Reading is pretty much the only skill with any useful competence right now. However, I have been solidly binging Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy. Thus far, I&rsquo;ve finished one book in Spanish (which you can catch the review of <a href="https://specual.me/posts/westernphilosophyinspanish/">here</a>.) My understanding of Spanish is significantly supplemented by my French at this point, so you won&rsquo;t be catching any written Spanish any time soon.</li>
<li>Esperanto: Studying on and off for a decade, I&rsquo;m an &rsquo;eterna komencanto&rsquo; (enternal beginner) in this amazing constructed language. My grammar isn&rsquo;t too bad, but I&rsquo;m lacking in vocab. Sed iun tagon, mi esperas, ke mia retejo estos parto de Esperantujo.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rating-system">Rating System</h2>
<p>While ratings can&rsquo;t paint the full picture on my experience of a book, they are pretty universally used across commercial book review sites and online stores. The following table shows my general rating guideline. However, in full disclosure, I do tend to rate self-pulished work a little more favourably than traditionally published work since a negative review disproportionately affects these authors. This may mean rounding up over down on a half star mind-rating, or could mean I refrain from publishing the rating on commercial sites.</p>

<td>Very good but there&rsquo;s room for improvement.</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="comments-and-privacy">Comments and Privacy</h2>
<p>The coments are powered by <a href="https://cactus.chat/">Cactus Chat</a>, which is a &ldquo;federated open-source comment system for the web, based on the Matrix protocol.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve chosen this system because I believe it is the most privacy-focused chat protocol I could find. It&rsquo;s compatible with any Matrix client, but you can also leave anonymous comments. I won&rsquo;t be going for a newsletter system unless I can make it privacy-centered as well.</p>
